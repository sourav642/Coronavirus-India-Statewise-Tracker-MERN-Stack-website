# Coronavirus-India-Statewise-Tracker-MERN-Stack-Website


    Created a simple MERN stack website to track the updated statewise coronavirus cases in INDIA.  

    Click on the graph icon beside state name to view the recent trends graph for that state.
        
The data is collected using a python script which runs once on each day and the data is stored inside MongoDB (Mongo Atlas free cluster on AWS).
